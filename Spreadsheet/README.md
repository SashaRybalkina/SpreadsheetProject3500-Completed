# Spreadsheet
This project stores the information of non-empty cells, and checks for circulations
that may occur with the dependencies of the cells. The project only stores the data
of the non-empty cells and keeps track of all of the dependencies of the cells, but
cannot evaluate the contents of a cell to a value.
# Time Estimation
I estimate needing 5 hours to complete AS4.
I estimate needing 6 hours to complete AS5
# Time Spent
I have spent a total of 14 hours working on spreadsheet. 3 hours were spent implementing
AS5, 4 hours were spent debugging code, 3 hours were spent fixing a mess up in git,
and a few minutes were spent learning how to use the tools.
# What I have learned about my time management
After coding several assignmnet, I have found it much easier to estimate the time that
I need for completion. Keeping track of how much time I may need has turned out to be
a very helpful tool for me, since I am able to pace myself with the work I need to get
done. I am not always able to correctly estimate how much time I will need to spend,
since some issues may come up and I need to spend time fixing it, but overall I my
estimations have been somewhat accurate.
# Examples of Good Software Practice
One of the exampels of me using GSP is through creating helper methods. For example,
when implementing the Formula class, I used two helper methods in the Evaluate method,
one for handling adding and subtracting, and one for handling multiplying and dividing,
which limited code repitition.

Another example of me using GSP is through using commenting and documentation where it
is appropriate. In the FormulaEvaluator class, I commented every single if statement
to create more clarity for the functioning of that if satement. In the DependencyGraph
and Formula classes, I documented every single method that the classes had, and clearly
defined the behavior of the methods, their parameters, and what they were supposed to
return.

The third example of me using GPS is through using proper versioning. For assignment 4,
I have been commiting regularly and giving meaningful comments to all of my commits.
Also, I have been adding tags to all of my commits.
