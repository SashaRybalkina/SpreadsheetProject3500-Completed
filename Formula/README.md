# Formula
This project is a refactoring of FormulaEvaluator, where Formulaevaluator is turned
into a reusable class.
# Time estimation
For this project I estimate needing 10 hours. Most of this time will be spent coding
the constructors and checking for every syntax error in the string formula entered.
# Time Spent
I needed less time than I estimated, and have spent a total of 7 hours coding and
debugging.
# IMPORTANT INFO REGARDING VERSIONING
Due to issues with connecting my GitHub repository with VisualStudio, I had to delete
my old repository and create a brand new one, so a lot of my versioning history is
lost.
