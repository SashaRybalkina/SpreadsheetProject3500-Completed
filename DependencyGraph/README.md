# DependencyGraph
This project creates a representation of a dependency graph by using two
dictionaries, one for the dependents of a string, and one for the dependees.
For every pair that gets added, the first item in the pair is treated as a
key in the "dependents" dictionary, and the second item is added to a list of
dependents for that spesific key. This same logic is also used for keeping
track of the dependees of the second item in the pair, with the second item
being treated as the key. This project can easily remove and replace any
dependency that exists in the graph.
# Time Estimation
I estimate that this project will take me 10 hours.
# Time Spent
I have spent a total of around 8 hours working on this project. Half of this
time was spent debugging.
