# Comments to Evaluators:

The spreadsheet is sometimes laggy and requires extra waiting time to load,
especially for the Randomize additional feature.

# Partnership

Sasha

-Built the GUI
-Wrote save warnings

Tori

-Wrote file save method
-Commented

Together

-Display pop ups
-Menus
-Majority of the methods

# Branching

Didn't make any branches but made sure to frequentely commit our work to git so
that each partner could contribute by pulling the most recent code.

# Additional Features

A "Randomizer" button which puts a random value into every single cell.

# Design descisions

Made the help menu have three different dropdowns for specific topics for more
clarity and better organization.

Made every selected cell highlighted to a different color

# Time Tracking

Estimated / Actual

	14 / 14

	Progress Towards Completion:	 	 10 Hours
	Debugging:							 3 Hours
	Spent Leraning Tools And Techniques: 1 Hours
	Spent Together:						 10 Hours
	Tori:								 2 Hours (commenting & writing SaveFile())
	Sasha:								 2 Hours (building the GUI and writing warnings)

	Our estimates are getting better than they originally were. We have gotten into a routine
	for completing the projects, setting aside a specific amount of time each day for how long
	we will spend on the code and how we will spend that time. Most of our time is spent in the TA
	office hours outside of our other classes. This has made it easier to estimate the time we will
	spend on the projects.

# Best Team Practices

Our partnership was most effective because we were able to find time to meet in person with
each other. Most of our programming was done together and in person, which allowed for better
communication of ideas. If one of us didn't understand something or was confused, the other was
able to effectively explain it and code. This made the coding process faster because we weren't
caught up on a singular topic for too long.

We could improve on time efficiency and starting on assignmnets earlier. We ran into an issue
where we felt like we needed more time than what we had left, which caused us to spend a long
period of time coding in one sitting. Overall, being better on time efficiency will allow us
to be less stressed and burned out.
